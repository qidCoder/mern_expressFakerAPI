# Faker API
To solidify the concepts of making our own api, we are going to create an api that generates a random user on a GET request. We will be using Postman to make our GET requests.



In this assignment, we will be using 2 javascript libraries to create a simple API that generates a User and/or Company depending on the route:

* Express (Server)
* Faker (Fake data generator)


Go ahead and follow the checklist below using the 2 classes below:

* User class
 * _id
  firstName
  lastName
  phoneNumber
  email
  password
Company class
_id
name
address
street
city
state
zipCode
country


## Faker
The faker library has a ton of methods we can use to populate specific fields with randomly generated data. Look through the faker [documentation](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) and search through the methods to choose the ones that you would use to populate each field.

**Here is an example of how we can use faker**

 Create a new project folder "Faker_API" and with your terminal, navigate into your new folder
 Create a package.json file using the "npm init -y" command in your terminal
 install express and faker
 Create a server.js file
 In your server.js file, Import express and faker
 Create 2 classes: User, Company with the same attributes as listed above
 Create an api route "/api/users/new" that returns a new user
 Create an api route "/api/companies/new" that returns a new company
 Create an api route "/api/user/company" that returns both a new user and a new company
 Run your server.js file using nodemon
 Using Postman, test your new GET routes
